  Description:
    Abstract: These data were originally developed and designed for Rhode Island Enhanced 9-1-1 purposes only. These data contain street center lines and address ranges for all highways, roads, and streets for the entire state of Rhode Island. AK Associates conflated this data from the existing road data developed by MicroDATA GIS, RI DOT, 2008 Pictometry and data provided by Municipal Agencies for Rhode Island Enhanced 9-1-1 (RI E-911).
    Purpose: These data were developed and are maintained in order to provide an accurate spatial reference for RI E-911 telecommunicators. These data are provided to RIGIS for redistribution as a public service by RI E-911.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Portions of this data set were collected as early as 2001. Inaccuracies do exist in these data and are therefore under constant revision. Any discrepancies, inaccuracies or inconsistencies recognized in these data should be reported to the pertinent municipality who should alert RI E-911.
      Users are also encouraged to email ri911gis@akassociates911.com with any suggested updates for this actively maintained dataset.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: These data is subject to constant revision and updating. An updated list of the Master Street Address Guide is downloaded monthly. This list is matched against existing GIS data in RI E-911's database. This alerts E-911 personnel to new or altered road names and address ranges. AK Associates' GIS department then matches the missing roads to their exact spatial location. This is done via field work, cross referencing with the latest RI DOT data, or eliciting the assistance of the pertinent municipality.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: This dataset is considered to be topologically clean.
  Completeness_Report: Line accuracy standards for the original data conversion were set as being within the confines of the visible road surface. Most road centerlines are expected to fall within about 3 to 5 meters of their true ground locations (except in cases where GPS field verification has not yet occurred and the road locations were not clearly visible on the photos or the road has been built since the orthophotos were taken). To improve connectivity and create 4-way road intersections, where the crossing street's centerline was offset slightly, short road sections (generally less than 50 feet) were removed and the crossing street's centerlines were edited to meet at a single node. New road locations were collected and inaccuracies were rectified using GPS receivers in the field. These centerlines are generally expected to be within 5 meters of its true location, but variations in GPS data collection quality can create variable results. This dataset includes all known new roads built between 2001 and the date this dataset was shared with RIGIS.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Original GIS source data from RIGIS (s44trd97) had a horizontal accuracy of plus or minus 3 to 5 meters, verified by RIGIS from check plots of all linework overlayed on orthophotos. In municipalities where field-verification has been completed by microDATA GIS,  orthophoto-based road centerlines have been checked and new construction road centerlines have been added within the original positional accuracy standards using vehicle-mounted GPS antennas & receivers, real-time differentially corrected (WAAS correction) .

      Process_Description:
        These data were originally developed and designed for Enhanced 9-1-1 purposes only. The E911\RDS data was originally developed using road centerlines from RIGIS & RIDOT (s44trd97). The original data was digitized in AutoCAD by Intermap Corp. for Narragansett Electric, a National Grid company, from 1:5000 scale spring 1997 photography. RI-DOT converted from AutoCAD DXF file format to ArcInfo coverage file format. In 2001, MicroDATA GIS converted the data from ArcInfo coverage to ESRI Shapefile format, and the projection from State Plane Feet to Geographic Decimal Degrees. Road name, address range, route number, and functional class attributes were conflated by MicroDATA GIS for RI-911 from 1:24,000 scale U.S. Census TIGER line roads, that had been enhanced by RIGIS & RIDOT. These road centerlines were audited by MicroDATA GIS to verify attribute accuracy, and route connectivity.
        Beginning in November 2001, proof plots were provided by RI E-911 to the E-911 coordinator for each municipality, and checked for road name accuracy. A listing of road names in the telephone company Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) that were missing in the GIS was provided with the proof plot. Where possible, missing roads from the MSAG listing were identified by the municipality from unnamed roads in the GIS. If possible, an approximate location was compiled on the proof plot by the municipality for the remaining missing MSAG roads. These new roads were digitized by MicroDATA GIS, with locations approximated from the proof plots, digital 1:5000 scale orthophotos, or other maps and data provided by the municipality.
        In December 2001, MicroDATA GIS and RI-911 began field-verifying all roads, road names, and sites; and adding new roads or sites using GPS. Year 1 of the project included field-verification in the municipalities of: Exeter, Glocester, and Tiverton. Year 2 of the project included field-verification in the municipalities of: South Kingstown, East Providence, North Providence (and Centerdale) Year 3 of the project included field-verification in the municipalities of: Newport, Middletown Year 4 of the project included field-verification in the municipalities of: Providence, West Warwick, Warwick Year 5 of the project included field-verification in the municipalities of: Cranston, Pawtucket, Narragansett, Woonsocket On a daily basis, verification data from the field was imported into the master data set, and checked by a GIS technician. As field-verification was completed in each municipality, an extensive set of automated and manual quality control audits were made to verify attribute accuracy, and route connectivity. Geocoding was updated from the TIGER values to the actual address range of existing sites along each road segment, and audited to verify attribute accuracy. Assessment reports of site addressing, road geocoding, roads in the MSAG that were missing in the GIS, and roads in the GIS missing from the MSAG were provided by MicroDATA GIS to RI-911 for evaluation by each municipality. After a period of municipal review, GIS roads data was published for use by RI-911 in 2008.

      Process_Description:
        Beginning in 2008 AK Associates took over E-911's GIS maintenance and implementation. AK Associates continues MicroDATA's quality assurance routines by way of MSAG and ALI audits. These monthly reports are used to alert GIS personnel of new and missing GIS data. 2008 Pictometry images were employed to locate roads that were constructed or modified since the last orthophotographs were collected in 2003-04. AK Associates has increased the level of municipal interaction through having scheduled weekly meetings with local GIS Liaisons. This allows communities and E-911 to proactively manage new developments and alleviate existing problems.
        Using MicroDATAs x9GIS software in concert with vehicle mounted GPS equipment, AK Associates' GIS personnel conducts field work in order to verify new and inaccurate data; illuminated byway MSAG and ALI audits.
        In addition to the above mentioned QA and QC procedures, AK Associates also closely monitors 9-1-1 calls received into the PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point). Call takers generate Map Discrepancies based on inaccurate or unclear GIS data. These discrepancies are rectified on premises and in a timely manner.

      Attribute_Label: Alias1
      Attribute_Definition:
        This is an alternate name that has been applied to the street. Is created initially by typing the name into the "Entire Street Name Editor". Can be edited through the "Entire Street Name Editor". These values will show in the Street Segment Editor if UseGeonamesAliases is Yes. If it is marked to No, the "Street Segment Editor" can be used to edit the name by segment. This is used for identifying street segments that potentially
        have a second name.
